      <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
      <p>This project offered valuable insights into FAFSA application patterns across schools, states, and student types over five academic quarters. Visualizations revealed clear institutional and regional differences in dependent vs independent student counts, with public institutions dominating overall volume.</p>

      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Public schools consistently lead in application volume across all quarters.</li>
        <li>Some states (e.g., CA, TX, NY) show concentrated FAFSA activity due to population size and institutional density.</li>
        <li>There is a relatively stable trend across quarters, with Q2 and Q4 often spiking due to school deadlines.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Recommendations</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>States with lower FAFSA participation may benefit from awareness campaigns and simplified filing systems.</li>
        <li>Policy should consider dependent/independent student differences for more equitable aid distribution.</li>
        <li>Future research could expand with year-over-year comparisons or institutional financial aid data integration.</li>
